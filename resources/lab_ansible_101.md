# Ansible Community Labs

These interactive learning scenarios provide you with a pre-configured Ansible environment to do a live laboratory during your meetup. 

Anyone with experience on the subject can take the intructor role, and use these interactive labs to provide a live workshop. 

The labs include instructions for each challenge, in some cases they might feature the "skip" and "check" options, which will automatically complete the required steps in that challenge for the former and verify everything was done correctly by the student in the latter. 

The environment runs entirely in the browser, the only requirement of assistants is to have a laptop or pc available at the time of the class.
