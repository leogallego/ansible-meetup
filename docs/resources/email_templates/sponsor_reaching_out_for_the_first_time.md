Hello {recipient's name},

I am {name} , co-organizer at Ansible {place/city of the meetup} Meetup [0].

Ansible is an open-source community project sponsored by Red Hat [1]. It is the simplest way to automate IT. Ansible delivers simple IT automation that ends repetitive tasks and frees up DevOps teams for more strategic work. Ansible Community [2] is a gathering of a small group of Systems Engineers, DevOps, and SREs to discuss their automation journey focusing on Ansible. Ansible {place/city of the meetup} Meetup is a place for Ansible users and developers of all types to meet each other, share knowledge and swap Ansible stories. We meet every month/once in two months to talk about the above-mentioned topics and ideas.

We are looking for sponsors currently to support our group. There are three ways to sponsor us :

- Venue Sponsor

 Provide the venue to hold the meetup of {} attendees (expected numbers) on {date and time}.

We are looking for a place to hold our meetups with the following specifications
    1. Expected Attendees are {number}
    2. Presentation setup
    3. Recording - audio, video setup, microphone for the audience
    4. Wifi
    5. Seating arrangement suitable for workshop
    6. Parking facility


- Food Sponsor

Providing the food to hold the meetup of {} attendees (expected numbers) on {date and time}. Here we have two categories :

 - Sponsor a meal (lunch/dinner)
 - Sponsor high tea (coffee, tea, and some snacks)

 - Group Support

 You have to sponsor the meetup group itself. Here you can help us by supporting both the venue and food.

We are happy to advertise and promote the sponsor from the official Ansible account on social media platforms Linkedin, Mastodon, Twitter, and Bullhorn, the Ansible contributor community newsletter. It would add to your reach not only locally but globally.

 Would you consider being a sponsor? It's also an excellent way to get your company's name out there as an innovative workplace that encourages and supports open-source development. It is a great way to give back to the community and learn from them.

Please let me know if you need further information.

We are looking forward to your reply.

Thank you,
{Your name}
