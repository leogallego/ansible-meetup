# Ansible Community Labs

The Ansible Community Labs are interactive learning scenarios provided with a pre-configured Ansible environment and embedded instructions to do a live laboratory during your meetup. 

Anyone with experience on the subject of the lab can take the intructor role and use these interactive labs to provide a live workshop. 

The labs include instructions for each chapters (also called challenges), in some cases the chapters might feature the "skip" and "check" options, which will automatically complete the required steps in that challenge for the former (skip) and verify everything was done correctly by the student in the latter (check). 

The lab environment runs entirely in the browser inside a single window (or tab), the only requirement is to have a device able to connect to the lab (laptop or PC preferred, but we have seen people use mobiles or tablets).
