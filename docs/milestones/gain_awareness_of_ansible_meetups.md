# What is an Ansible Meetup?

An [Ansible Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ansible/) is a gathering of a small to medium-sized group of Systems Engineers, DevOps, and SREs. Attendees talk about their automation journey, focusing on Ansible. Meetups are a place to teach and learn from each other. Meetups provide a platform for the open source community and customers to meet and share ideas.

Ansible Meetups are a group effort. A successful Meetup needs:

* Attendees - to learn, share, and network with other Ansible enthusiasts.
* Presenters - to give talks or facilitate discussions during the event.
* Meetup hosts - to provide the venue where the Meetup will happen if it is not an on-line only event.
* Meetup organizers - to find a venue to host the Meetup, coordinate presenters, and plan and execute the Meetup.

## Attending a Meetup

To find and join a local Meetup:

1. Search the list of [Ansible Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ansible/) for one near you.
2. Optionally, click **Join Group** to join that Meetup.
3. Find the next Meetup event in that group and click **Attend** or follow the registration instructions.


## Presenting at the Meetup

Do you want to present at an Ansible Meetup? Do you have an idea for a session? Use one the following options to reach out to the Meetup group with your presentation idea:

- Comment on the Meetup page itself.
- Contact the organizers through Meetup.com direct messages.
- Open an issue at the [Github repo of the meetup group](https://github.com/ansible-community/?q=meetup) for that Meetup (if available).
- Share your idea in the [#ansible-social](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) Matrix room or one of the [regional rooms](https://matrix.to/#/#ansible-regional:matrix.org).


Meetup organizers always look for good presenters to enrich their events and Meetup groups, so do not hold back from sharing your ideas.

## Hosting a Meetup

Meetup hosts provide the venue where the Meetup event happens.

Want to host a meetup at your organization? Reach out to the Meetup organizer in your area by any of the methods listed above or send us an [email](mailto:meetup@ansible.com) and we can help you make the connection to your local Meetup organizer.

## Organizing a Meetup

No Ansible Meetup in your area? Send us an [email](mailto:meetup@ansible.com) introducing yourself. Be sure to include a link to your profile at Meetup.com.

We want to be sure that Meetup organizers are committed to building a strong, local community of Ansible users. After a brief discussion, we will create the Ansible Meetup group in your area, appoint you as a co-organizer, and announce your new group to the world.

Secure a date and location for your first Meetup! We will help you by spreading the word on social media, reaching out to potential speakers and sponsors in your area, and suggesting new and interesting Ansible content on a regular basis.

### Who can become an organizer?

Anyone from the wider Ansible community who is committed to run an Ansible Meetup group and plan/organize Meetups can become an organizer. The fundamental understanding of the Open Source community, its working, and the belief in this ethos is essential to be an efficient community builder. Some knowledge about Ansible is always a plus.

## Ansible Community Code of Conduct

All Ansible Meetups must comply with the [Ansible Community Code of Conduct](ttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/code_of_conduct.html).
