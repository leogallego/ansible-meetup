# Post-event activities

Consider the following activities after your event.

## Gathering Feedback

It is essential to gather feedback from the participants about the event at the end of the Meetup.It gives the insight to the organizers on how to improve the Meetup content and event. You can gather feedback using the following options:

- Meetup.com (Feedback tool)
- Email
- In-person feedback during the Meetup
- Relevant Ansible Matrix room

## Plan for the next Meetup

Decide on the frequency of the Meetup you as a group want to have, and then plan for the Meetup as soon as possible after the current Meetup is over. It gives attendees time in advance to plan for the Meetup. Also, encourage attendees to share the content for the Meetup topic using any of the above mentioned tools and platforms. The Meetup group is at liberty to use their preferred platform for communication. The private Matrix room helps to keep the connection alive and continue with the conversation.
