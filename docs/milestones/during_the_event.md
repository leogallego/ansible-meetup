# Guidelines during the event

Now the big day is here, the day of the event. And you are all ready for it ðŸ™‚. Here are the guidelines for the day of the Meetup that can make your life easier as an organizer. These are some steps that, if you follow them, will make your life easier as an organizer.

## Strict Guidelines

1. Follow the Ansible Community Code of Conduct at all times during the event. Read about the [Ansible Code of Conduct](ttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/code_of_conduct.html)(CoC) prior the event. It helps the organizer to understand the ethos of the Ansible Community. 
2. Be inclusive.
3. Take care of the security concerns.
4. Announce the name of the person of contact in case of CoC violations along with the mode of communications.
6. Make sure that you have a first aid kit ready.
7. Ask all attendees, speakers, and volunteers for photography permissions.
8. Ask for permission of the attendees, speakers and volunteers to be tagged in social media.

## Good to follow Guidelines

1. Time Management

    Start and end the event on time. Ensure speakers also keep to their time allowance, especially if you have multiple speakers. This is respectful to people's time, especially the later speakers in the agenda.

2. Round table introduction

    A round table introduction before the Meetup helps us to create a network with the attendees. This helps organizers get to know attendees and their work and experience levels. You can often find future speakers, organizers, or volunteers among the event attendees so it is always worth asking for help.

3. Feedback session

    An honest and frank feedback session at the end of the Meetup is essential. Encourage the participants to comment on the Meetup page or fill up the Meetup.com feedback form for giving their feedback. You can ask the following questions in there:

    - How was the event ?
    - Was it helpful for the attendees?
    - How can the meetup improve?
    - What are the topics you would like to hear more about in future sessions?

5. Fix the plan for the next session

    It is advisable to plan the next event, the date, venue and brief agenda at the end of the Meetup. The attendees leave with a definitive date to be booked on their calendar. Also, it gives them some idea where the community is heading. Once you make the plan with the attendees, they feel more included. Giving their wishes priority to essentially make them feel a part of the group itself.

6. How to connect with the Ansible Community?

    Encourage the attendees to join the Ansible Community [Matrix channel](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#general-channels) and show them how to join Matrix if they are not there.
    Join the Ansible Community Matrix space, find a regional channel they can connect in. You may start a private Matrix room with the attendees to be connected.

    Also encourage them to join the  [Ansible Community forum](https://forum.ansible.com/)
